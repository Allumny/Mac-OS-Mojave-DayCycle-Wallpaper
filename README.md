Mac OS Mojave DayCycle Wallpaper


code by https://github.com/trongthanh located in: https://gist.github.com/trongthanh/7d632e90687e1bc219e1f3262d337702

i just unified the images and the code in the same repo so it'll be easier to assemble.

code can be slightly modified from the original to fill time conditions in UTC -3 (Sao Paulo) (sun arrives earlier and sets at 18PM).
